        <h1>Outdoor Sports</h1>

        <p>
          Outdoor sports are games and physical activities played in open spaces
          such as grounds, stadiums, and fields. These sports are not only
          exciting but also help improve stamina, endurance, and overall health
          since they are played in natural environments. Examples include
          football, cricket, hockey, and athletics. Outdoor games are often
          team-oriented, but some can be played individually as well.
