    <h1>Team Sports</h1>

    <p class="one">
      Team sports are games played between groups of players who work together
      to achieve a common goal. These sports focus on coordination,
      communication, and teamwork, where every player contributes to the overall
      performance. Popular team sports include football, cricket, basketball,
      hockey, and volleyball. Team sports not only improve physical fitness but
      also teach leadership, cooperation, and strategy.
