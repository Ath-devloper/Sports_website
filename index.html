    </h1>
    <p>
      Sports are physical or mental activities that involve skill, competition,
      and teamwork. They play an important role in keeping us fit, healthy, and
      disciplined. Sports also teach values like teamwork, leadership, patience,
      and fair play. From outdoor games like football, cricket, and basketball
      to indoor games like chess and table tennis, sports bring people together
      and are enjoyed all over the world.
