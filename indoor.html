    <h1>Indoor Sports</h1>

    <p>
      Indoor sports are games and physical activities played within a covered
      space such as gymnasiums, halls, or indoor arenas. These sports are less
      dependent on weather conditions, making them enjoyable year-round. They
      help improve concentration, agility, and coordination. Popular indoor
      sports include badminton, table tennis, chess, basketball, and volleyball.
