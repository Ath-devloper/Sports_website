    <h1>Individual Sports</h1>

    <p>
      Individual sports are played by a single participant competing against
      another individual or against time. These sports test personal skill,
      endurance, and mental focus. Unlike team sports, success here depends
      entirely on one’s own performance and preparation. Popular individual
      sports include athletics, swimming, boxing, gymnastics, and tennis.
